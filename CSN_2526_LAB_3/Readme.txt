All the experiments results are already inside each folder:
|_data/ contains all the data produced and needed to run the experiments
|_images/ contains the plots
|_src/ contains all the python scripts used for the experiment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to reproduce our experiments results you have to follow these steps:
1) Open the Lab_3.ipynb file
2) Check to have installed all the required libraries in the first code cell
3) Click the "run all" button in order to obtain all the results
3.1) The code will reproduce every output of the experiment with the existing Monte Carlo simulation already computed
3.2) If you want to reproduce also all the Monte Carlo simulation, just uncomment the two commented cells in order to run the python script
